        - What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

        It can be intimidating to begin working from a "blank canvas" but knowing the initial steps simply to get something down (head, title, doctype etc.) made me feel like I was developing a process for beginning a page. After I had written some markup, it became much easier to continue working confidently.

        - How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

        HTML5 appears to be very well documented and researching for specific syntax or symbols was very easy.

        - How did you do at keeping to best practices?

        I believe we did fairly well at keeping to best practices and only skirted the rules in a couple situations in the interest of making the site look as similar as possible to the example. We set the header of the page to h3 rather than h1, which was likely an infraction. We also set the width of the line which is likely better accomplished in CSS.

        - What seems good and bad about HTML?

        HTML is fairly adept at creating a purely informational site so long as its design is in keeping with a kind of "textbook-like" format. However, HTML seems to be fairly forgiving with matters of syntax. Tags can be left open in some places without breaking the site completely. This could contribute to less-than-best practices creeping in.

        - What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

        Typing the opening and closing tags at the same type helps tremendously when writing HTML. Trying to close tags after the fact can often be extremely confusing. Also, beginning every site with the head and body as a first step helps to organize and orient you for the rest of the project. Breaking a site into smaller segments and working on each individually can help to make a large project more manageable. Looking at an entire site as a whole can often be a daunting prospect if you do not whittle it down into its component pieces.
