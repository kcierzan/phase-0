# Though I had heard of and used the Pomodoro Method in the past, the Fogg Method as well as many of the techniques described by Charles Duhigg were new for me. Both Fogg and Duhigg's methods of breaking down habits into easy components that require minimal motivation are sure to serve me well. "Time boxing" is concept of allowing a delimited amount of time to be the limiting factor in the completion of a task, rather than the scope of the task itself. Time is broken into chunks and the work completed in that time is evaluated once time runs out. In phase 0, I plan to use the Pomodoro Method as a means of "time boxing". This will allow me to evaluate my productivity and learning progress as I will have clearly distinct "efforts" that I can evaluate and monitor, rather than a much more abstract sense of "am I doing well?". Currently, I am attempting to approximate a typical 9 - 5 work schedule however I am concerned that the rigidity of this schedule may become an issue with the realities of working from home and being surrounded by potential distractions. Sometimes my strategies are overly ambitious and not sustainable. Regarding my overall plan, I feel I may be better served by maintaining a somewhat more flexible schedule and incorporating a fixed number of "time boxes" through the Pomodoro Method. This will allow me to adjust my schedule to accommodate the realities of life, while allowing me to keep better track of my progress and ability.
## A shell is a command line interface where one is able to interact with the computer in a text-based format. This is in contrast to the GUI which displays files, directories, and commands graphically. Bash is an example of a shell that runs on Unix-like systems like linux and OSX.



This material was not particularly challenging as I had completed the Command Line Crash Course via Zed Shaw's "Learn Ruby the Hard Way" site prior to phase 0. I did however enjoy the additional practice and review as I learned much more about "find" and "help" commands. I was able to successfully use all the commands, though I did struggle for a bit when referencing certain files/directories from an inappropriate working directory that was too far down the "directory tree". I believe the most important commands are "ls", "cd", and "man". cd (especially with the ../ argument) and ls help to move and orient you in the file system while man provides an incredible amount of information which is useful for more esoteric commands.



pwd: prints working directory

ls: displays contents of working directory

mv: moves (renames) a file or directory

cd: changes directory. Without an argument moves the working directory to the user's directory.

../: argument used with cd. moves the working directory "up" one level in the directory tree. Can be strung together.

touch: creates a file

mkdir: creates a directory

less: pages through a file's contents

rmdir: removes a directory

rm: removes a file

help: prints brief description of builtin commands
