          <strong>Version control</strong> is similar to having multiple saves in a video game instead of one save file you overwrite; it allows you to see when you saved, what you were doing when you saved, and you can go back to that save if you mess up later in the game. Version control is not just used by developers-it can be used for any number of things to keep track of overall progress on a project. The great thing about version control is that it helps prevent fatal mistakes from being made. Think of it as a series of do-overs.

          Once we have completed our desired changes and updates, we can use git to commit and push our code to our GitHub repository. <strong>GitHub</strong> is a web service that allows individuals and teams to manage projects and to collaborate and contribute to one another's projects in a nondestructive way. GitHub is useful because it stores the code so that it can be accessed and edited by others using what are called "forks". Forks allow one to copy the code of another for the purpose of adding or, in some cases perhaps, removing features. GitHub maintains extensive records of every new "commit" or update, who did it and any comments or descriptions about that particular action. It is easy to develop a timeline of changes and the thinking and personalities involved. GitHub also functions as social media, where one can view the projects and contributions of other users. This is concept is playing a larger and larger role in the fiding work in the software development industry, as it is easy for potential employers to see the projects a prospective employee has completed.

    What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

    Today we used main, article, section, and strong. I believe we had a tendency to come back to section as it seemed like it was a semantically valuable tag to use for the different questions we were answering in our blogs. Article was useful because it was semantically descriptive and useful tag for the entireity of our reflections. Strong was also used as a way to emphasize text without the need for traditional headers.

    How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

    Elements are laid out on the page according to their immediate tags and any parents tags that are associated with them. HTML defines default behavior and appearance for various tags like links, headers, asides etc. The browser displays elements according to their place in the page hierarchy and the tags associated with them

    What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

    I learned that Sublime is capable of storing and using user-created snippets for quick shortcuts to lengthy bits of code. This definitely has me interested in the customisability of sublime as it seems perfectly suited for making the more tedious aspects of writing code faster and more efficient.
